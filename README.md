# Serverless URL Shortener
This is a serveless URL shortener app. It uses AWS as cloud and Api gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB and cloudFront as services. 
The app outputs an enpoint that are used in two cases:

1. Final user will enter endpoint/{shortKey} in a web browser and will be redirect to the fullURL
1. The administration API is available at endpoint/api and have the following methods:
    - ```GET``` Returns the fullURL and requires the shortKey parameter on query. Ex.: endpoint/api?shortKey=ABCDE
    - ```POST``` Create the shortKey and requires the fullURL encoded parameter on query. Ex.: endpoint/api?fullURL=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.mercadolivre.com.br%252F
    - ```DELETE``` Deletes an Item and requires the shortKey parameter on query. Ex.: endpoint/api?shortKey=ABCDE

## Deployment

### Requirements
* An AWS Account with permission to run the components in us-east-1 or sa-east-1
* Know how to deploy a CloudFormation <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">AWS CloudFormation</a> 

### Cloudformation Template

 <a href="https://github.com/wjunior08/URLShortener/blob/main/urlShortener-template.yaml" target="_blank">ðŸ“œ[Cloudformation Template]</a> 

### CloudFront

On the CloudFormation deployment the parameter ```useCloudfront``` will control if the CloudFront distribution, routes, function and keyValueStore will be deployed. If set to no the endpoint used will be the API Gateway endpoint. 
If Yes, all /api operation will be passed to the api gateway. On the redirect call(/{shortKey}) the CloudFront function will first search for the key on the key value store, in a case of error the function will delivery the request to api gateway.

### Authentication  

On the CloudFormation deployment the parameter ```EnableAPiAuth``` will control if the resources to enable authentication will be deployed. If set to no all API operations will be open.
In Yes the operations get, delete, and create will require a Bearer token. To get the retrieve a token the '''AuthenticationDomain''' output of the template will contain an URL that user can use to signin and singup. After authenticate user will receive the access_token.


### Cleanup
1. Open the <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home" target="_blank">CloudFormation console</a>
1. Locate the a stack you've deployed
1. Select the radio option next to it
1. Select **Delete**
1. Select **Delete stack** to confirm

*Note: Some logs may be reitained on cloudWatch
